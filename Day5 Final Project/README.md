Please follow the PPT to get the idea for the final project background. In this Day5 lab, we prepared the data for you but much of the model building and training is hidden. You can use the knowledge you learned from previous classes to complete the code flow. The final model should achieve around 90% accuracy. 

You do NOT have to work on this project. You'll be able to work on your own project that requires similar effort. Talk to the instructor if you are not sure about the depth of your own project. This final project accounts for 60% of the final grade.
