This is a project-based, 15-hour intensive course on advanced computer vision developed by Yalong Pi and Haoyu Niu at TAMIDS. Some materials are inspired by NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute workshops. Participants will
explore topics such as image classification, transfer learning, object detection, segmentation, and
real-world projects. Through a combination of lectures and hands-on lab sessions, students will gain
practical skills in implementing algorithms such as ResNet, VGG, YOLO, DETR, Mask RCNN, and UNet. By
the end of the course, participants will be equipped to analyze visual data and apply deep learning
techniques to solve real-world computer vision challenges.
